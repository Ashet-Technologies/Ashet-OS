Welcome to my gemlog! I'm trying to build a small blog here
where i talk about projects and have some ramblings and
thoughts shared.

## About me

I'm Felix "xq" Queissner, demoscener and coder from Germany.
I discovered computers way too early in my life and spent too
much time on them.

Interests are in speeding up things and make software with
less cruft.

## Projects

This is a list of projects i maintain or work on. Not every
project is listed, but these are the ones i can show off
without feeling bad for either project state or quality:

- Ashet Home Computer
- Kristall Small-Internet Browser
- The LoLa Programming Language
