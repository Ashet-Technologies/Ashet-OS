# Ashet OS - Multiplatform Architecture

## Terms

Platform: CPU architecture (risc-v, arm, x86)
Machine:  A specialized (or generic) implementation for a certain platform (Ashet Home Computer, qemu-riscv/virt, qemu-arm/virt, qemu-x86/microvm)
Driver:   Implementation of a certain device (or kind of device)

## Components

  core:
    - Implements all functionality for the operating system
    - Provides driver implementations
    - Handles drivers

  driver:
    - Implements a behaviour for a system component or device
    - Might be platform or machine specific

  machine:
    - defines the platform
    - initializes machine and provides a memory map
    - initializes drivers
  
  platform:
    - contains implementations for the support for the cpu architecture
    - contains implementation of the scheduler switchTasks function
      - is highly platform specific, but not machine specific

## Code Structure

Just one huge source tree, and a comptime option "machine" which is 
used to select everything else from the source tree. This allows to
have a simple code structure that just switches on things instead of
having to orchestrate a lot of packages into dependency loops.
