## The Log

- “Copy from browser → paste as reference → links stored with metadata”
- Let people drag notifications into other apps (like dragging a chat message into the todo list = creates a task).
- Drag file to canvas: the file-type associated app starts there, opening your file
- store files by dragging file save icon to file browser (shoutout to RISC OS)
- “Hey UAC, when I plug in a USB stick with more than 1GB of images, ask if I want to launch PhotoSort, unless I’m on battery.”
