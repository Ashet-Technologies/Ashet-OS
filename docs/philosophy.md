# Ashet OS Philosophy

Ashet OS isn't your regular daily-driver OS. It is meant to provide two core values:

* Education
* Fun

It is meant to invite for tinkering, changing, hacking your machine, your OS, your software, â€¦

## OS Zen

Consider this some basic hints on which ideas lead to the design decisions in the OS:

* Protect against programmers mistakes, but not against programmers intent.
* Challenge everything. Think in first principles, reinvent everything.
* Unix and Windows aren't the only operating systems. Look left and right of your daily path, you may find good ideas here and there.
* User experience matters more than you think.

## Design Goals

* Make an operating system that *COULD* be used as a daily driver
* Try to find new, exciting ways of doing things
* Simple enough to be grasped by a single person in a week or less
